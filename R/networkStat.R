#' Calculating network summary statistics
#'
#' \code{networkStat} calculates main network statistics.
#'
#' The function \code{\link{networkStat}} can calculate the main network statistics from a bibliographic network previously created by \code{\link{biblioNetwork}}.
#' @param object is a network matrix obtained by the function \code{\link{biblioNetwork}} or an graph object of the class \code{igraph}. 
#' @return It is a list containing the following elements:
#' \tabular{lll}{
#' \code{graph} \tab  \tab a network object of the class \code{igraph}\cr
#' \code{network} \tab  \tab a \code{\link{communities}} a list with the main statistics of the network\cr
#' \code{vertex} \tab  \tab a data frame with the main measures of centrality and prestige of vertices.\cr}

  # with high numbers interpreted to be of higher importance. 
  # standardized index is: Ei/(N-1)

  # Closeness centrality. 
  # Nodes can also be indexed by con-sidering their geodesic distance to each other.
  CC <- suppressWarnings(closeness(net, vids = V(net), mode = c("all"), normalized = TRUE))
  
  
  # Betweenness centrality. 
  # Another way to gauge a node's influence is to consider its role in linking other nodes together in the network.
  BC <- betweenness(net, v = V(net), directed = FALSE, weights = NULL, nobigint = TRUE, normalized = TRUE)

  # Eigenvector centrality is another measure of centrality. 
  # The eigenvector centrality ofeach node can be found by computing the leading

  ### Hubs and authorities
  # The hubs and authorities algorithm developed by Jon Kleinberg was initially used to examine web pages. 
  # Hubs were expected to contain catalogs with a large number of outgoing links; while authorities would get 
  # many incoming links from hubs, presumably because of their high-quality relevant information.
